1. All the experiments have been run on GPU using CUDA. Therefore all the codes should be run on GPU using CUDA.

2. The Code directory contains the folders question2.1 and question2.2 in which all the images related to the experiments will be saved ( Note : when running the code, the images will not be displayed on screen but insted be saved in these respective folders.)

3. The folder images_for_ocular_experiment contains the images selected for the Occlusion sensitivity experiment.

4. The models folder contains the model with best paramaters obtained from experiments.

5. The models_of_Q1 folder is the location where models will be saved after running the Q1.py file of first question.

6. For running the code please paste the train, val and test dataset folders in the code directory.
